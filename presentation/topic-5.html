    # CUSTOMIZATION
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    One principle we should follow is that, if native method is avaliable and fulfill 
    our requirements perfectly, we should use it without any hesitation since native 
    mathod has **_unmatchable proformance_** than the script snippets we written.

    DO NOT use custom scrollbars unless you know what you are doing. <br><br>

    Customizing scrollbars is always a controversial issue. On the one hand, 
    it provides full control of scrollbars. But on the other hand, it degrades user 
    experience because native behavior is unmatchable. As the author of this script, 
    I don't really want you to use it unless you are sure about what you are doing.<br><br>

    However...
  </section>
  <section>
    In lots of situation, we really need customized scroll behaviors that browser cannot 
    provided natively.
  </section>
  <section>
    For examples:
  </section>
  <section>
    <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo()</span> is great, but if we would like "scroll to" 
    behaviors happen within a specified container which is not the <span class="code-text">window</span> 
    object. <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo()</span> cannot not help us.
  </section>
  <section>
    <span class="code-text">Element.scrollIntoView()</span> works well, until we need element showing within 
    viewport with some customized offsets.
  </section>
  <section>
    <span class="code-text">scroll-behavior: smooth</span> is elegant, but we cannot customize 
    detailed scroll behavior -- maybe we would like elements scroll quicker in first half distance, with 
    slower scrolling speed during second half distance.
  </section>
  <section>
    Also, scroll bar "momentum" scrolling style provided by <span class="code-text">-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch</span> 
    is monotonous. If we want longer momentum slow down distance, for example, we need the 
    help of external scripts.
