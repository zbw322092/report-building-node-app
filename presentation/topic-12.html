    `_translate` method
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > By default the engine uses the `transform` CSS property. Setting this to false scrolls like we were in 2007, ie: using the top/left (and thus the scroller needs to be absolutely positioned).
    ... be warned: performance loss is huge.

    <textarea data-template>
      > iScroll uses CSS `transition` to perform animations (momentum and bounce). By setting this to `false`, `requestAnimationFrame` is used instead. <br>
      On modern browsers the difference is barely noticeable. On older devices transitions perform better.
