  <section>Just thinking about, What is the core of scroll components, without reading any code?</section>
  <section>Yes, it is SCROLL.</section>
  <section>HOWEVER, You Guess What.</section>
  <section>
    Browsers can scroll automatically, we need do nothing. It is a truth everybody knows.

  <section data-background-image="./assets/img-question-face.gif"></section>
  <section>So, now the question is, Why we need scroll components?</section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Yes, sometimes, we need scroll to a specified postion! ( `y` 400px maybe )
  </section>
  <section>But, native method
    <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo()</span> can deal with that.</section>
  <section>
    Well, but we need SMOOTH scroll!
    <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo()</span> is not enough!
  </section>

  <section>
    No, we have
    <span class="code-text">smooth-behavior</span> css property can make scroll smoothly.
    <pre>
      <code data-trim data-noescape>
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
      </code>
    </pre>
  </section>

  <section>
    Ok, but, what about scrolling to a specified HTML element?
  </section>
  <section>
    Also, native method can help us. It is <span class="code-text">Element.scrollIntoView()</span>

    <pre>
      <code data-trim data-noescape>
          var element = document.getElementById("box");
          
          element.scrollIntoView();
          element.scrollIntoView(false);
          element.scrollIntoView({block: "end"});
          element.scrollIntoView({behavior: "smooth", block: "end", inline: "nearest"});
      </code>
    </pre>

    You can even config smooth scroll in <span class="code-text">Element.scrollIntoView()</span> method.

    Now we know native methods will help us, are these method perfect?
