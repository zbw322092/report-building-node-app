    ## Polyfill Libraries
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Imagining that, if we developing a PC frontend application, which just requires 
    some  simple "smooth skip to" effect, it would be crazy to include the whole `iScroll` 
    core build file.

  <section>
    <span class="code-text">scroll-behavior: smooth</span> helps with compatibility problems.<br> 
    Now, polyfill comes in.

    The library implements <span class="code-text">window.scroll</span>, <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">window.scrollBy</span>, <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scroll</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollTo</span>, <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollBy</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollIntoView</span> polyfills, with smooth scrolling effects.

    To understand the codes, being basic again.

      As we known, browser vendors build their javascript engine according to _ECMAScript Starandard_.

    For example, `ECMA‚Äê262` introduces `ES6 arrow function` and browser vendors implement it and then, 
    you can execute this syntax natively in browser.

    Now, a very basic but tricky question is: <br>
    <span class="code-text">window.scroll, Element.scrollIntoView</span> or those methods mentioned above, 
    are they a part of <span class="code-text">ECMAScript Starandard</span> ?
