    ## Polyfill Libraries
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Imagining that, if we developing a PC frontend application, which just requires 
    some  simple "smooth skip to" effect, it would be crazy to include the whole `iScroll` 
    core build file.
  </section>
  <section>
    <span class="code-text">scroll-behavior: smooth</span> helps with compatibility problems.<br> 
    Now, polyfill comes in.
  </section>

    The library implements <span class="code-text">window.scroll</span>, <span class="code-text">window.scrollTo</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">window.scrollBy</span>, <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scroll</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollTo</span>, <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollBy</span>, 
    <span class="code-text">Element.prototype.scrollIntoView</span> polyfills, with smooth scrolling effects.

    To understand the codes, being basic again.

    <div data-markdown>
      As we known, browser vendors build their javascript engine according to _ECMAScript Starandard_.
      (Although varying degrees of conformance to the standard)
    </div>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    For example, `ECMA‚Äê262` introduces `ES6 arrow function` and browser vendors implement it and then, 
    you can execute this syntax natively in browser.
  </section>
  <section>
    Now, a very basic but tricky question is: <br>
    <span class="code-text">window.scroll, Element.scrollIntoView</span> or those methods mentioned above, 
    are they a part of <span class="code-text">ECMAScript Starandard</span> ?
  </section>
  <section>
    The answer is
  </section>
  <section>
    Absolutely, no.

    > The [W3C DOM](https://www.w3.org/DOM/) and [WHATWG DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) standards are 
    implemented in most modern browsers.

    We interact with `DOM` everyday, now we make it clearer.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Key concepts to understand `DOM`.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > The `Document Object Model` is a **platform- and language-neutral interface** that 
    will allow programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure 
    and style of documents.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > The `Document Object Model (DOM)` is a programming interface for `HTML` and `XML` 
    documents. **It represents the page so that programs can change the document 
    structure, style, and content.** The DOM represents the document as **nodes and 
    objects**. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > The Document Object Model (DOM) **connects** web pages to scripts or programming languages.
    The DOM model represents a document with a logical tree.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > Each branch of the tree ends in a **node**, and each node **contains objects** ... Nodes can have **event handlers attached** to them. Once an event is 
    triggered, the event handlers get executed.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > The `DOM` is an **object-oriented representation** of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Javascript and DOM
    > but it(javascript) uses the DOM to access the document and its elements. The DOM is 
    not a programming language, but without it, the JavaScript language **wouldn't 
    have any model or notion** of web pages, HTML documents, XML documents, and their 
    component parts (e.g. elements).
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    > The `DOM` was designed to be **independent** of any particular programming 
    language, making the structural representation of the document 
    available from a single, **consistent API**.

    ``` python
    # Python DOM example
    import xml.dom.minidom as m
    doc = m.parse("C:\\Projects\\Py\\chap1.xml");
    doc.nodeName # DOM property of document object;
    p_list = doc.getElementsByTagName("para");
    ```

    HTML and DOM <br>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-html.png"> <br>
    Do the HTML codes we daily written is DOM?
  </section>
  <section>
    No
  </section>
  <section>
    So what about the html codes show within "view sources" page? Are they DOM? <br>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-view-source.png"> <br>
  </section>
  <section>
    No neither.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    The HTML code need to be **parsed** (most of time by browsers) to become DOM.
  </section>
  <section>
    So, the structure shown in browser DEV Tools is DOM.

    Let's talk about a little bit details about DOM.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    First, a basic question. What is the difference between `Window` and `window`, 
    `Document` and `document`.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Short answer is, `Window` is the interface, `window` is the "instance".
  </section>
  <section>
    Secondly, the inheritance of DOM.
  </section>
  <section>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-HTMLInputElement.jpg"> <br>
    <span data-markdown>
      As we can see, `input` is an instance of `HTMLInputElement`, it has `require` and 
      `addEventListener` Properties.
    </span>
  </section>
  <section>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-HTMLParagraphElement.jpg"> <br>
    <span data-markdown>
      `p` is an instance of `HTMLParagraphElement`, it has `addEventListener` property, 
      with ``require` property `undefined`.
    </span>
  </section>
  <section>
    It is because DOM works like object-oriented object, with inheritance feature.
  </section>
  <section>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-inheritance-HTMLParagraphElement.jpg"> <br>
    <img data-src="./assets/img-inheritance-HTMLInputElement.jpg"> <br>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Both `HTMLParagraphElement` and `HTMLInputElement` inherit from properties from 
    `EventTarget` interface which implements `addEventListener` method. It's why both 
    these two interfaces have `addEventListener` method. Yet, `HTMLInputElement` not 
    only inherit properties from `EventTarget`, itself implements `require` property 
    according to DOM standard.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
        It's why we can write HTML code like this:
        ```
        <input type="number" require="true" />
        ```
        and `require` property is not working on `p` element
        ```
        <p require="true">something here</p>
        ```
    </textarea>

    DOM basic stop here. Code now.
