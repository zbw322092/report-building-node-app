    # Webpage Rendering
  </section>
  <section>
    The first key point need to be clarify is the webpage rendering process.
  </section>
  <section>
    We write HTML, CSS and Javascript code, browser processes them, and then, 
    image shown. <br>
    what happened underneath?

    Process 1: JavaScript
    > Typically JavaScript is used to handle work that will result 
    in visual changes, whether it’s jQuery’s animate function, sorting a data set, 
    or adding DOM elements to the page. It doesn’t have to be JavaScript that 
    triggers a visual change, though: CSS Animations, Transitions, and the Web 
    Animations API are also commonly used.

    Process 2: Style calculations
    > This is the process of figuring out which CSS rules apply to which elements 
    based on matching selectors.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 3: Layout
    > Once the browser knows which rules apply to an element it can begin to 
    calculate how much **space it takes up** and **where** it is on screen. The web’s layout 
    model means that one element can **affect others**.
  </section>

    Process 4: Paint
    > Painting is the process of **filling in pixels**. It involves drawing out text, 
    colors, images, borders, and shadows, essentially every visual part of the 
    elements. The drawing is typically done onto **multiple surfaces**, often called 
    **layers**.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 5: Compositing
    > Since the parts of the page were drawn into potentially multiple layers 
    they need to be drawn to the screen in the correct order so that the page 
    renders correctly.

    Performance is the art of **avoiding work**, and making any work you do as efficient 
    as possible. <br>
    In many cases it's about working with the browser, **not against it**.
