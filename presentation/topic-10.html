    # Webpage Rendering
  </section>
  <section>
    The first key point need to be clarify is the webpage rendering process.
  </section>
  <section>
    We write HTML, CSS and Javascript code, browser processes them, and then, 
    image shown. <br>
    what happened underneath?

    Process 1: JavaScript
    > Typically JavaScript is used to handle work that will result 
    in visual changes, whether it’s jQuery’s animate function, sorting a data set, 
    or adding DOM elements to the page. It doesn’t have to be JavaScript that 
    triggers a visual change, though: CSS Animations, Transitions, and the Web 
    Animations API are also commonly used.

    Process 2: Style calculations
    > This is the process of figuring out which CSS rules apply to which elements 
    based on matching selectors.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 3: Layout
    > Once the browser knows which rules apply to an element it can begin to 
    calculate how much **space it takes up** and **where** it is on screen. The web’s layout 
    model means that one element can **affect others**.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 4: Paint
    > Painting is the process of **filling in pixels**. It involves drawing out text, 
    colors, images, borders, and shadows, essentially every visual part of the 
    elements. The drawing is typically done onto **multiple surfaces**, often called 
    **layers**.

      Process 5: Compositing
      > Since the parts of the page were drawn into potentially multiple layers 
      they need to be drawn to the screen in the correct order so that the page 
      renders correctly. <br>
      > Compositing is where the painted parts of the page are put together for 
      displaying on screen.

      Performance is the art of **avoiding work**, and making any work you do as efficient 
      as possible. <br><br>
      In many cases it's about working with the browser, **not against it**.

      - Stick to transform and opacity changes for your animations.
      - Promote moving elements with will-change or translateZ.
      - Avoid overusing promotion rules; layers require memory and management.
