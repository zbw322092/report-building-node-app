    # Webpage Rendering
  </section>
  <section>
    The first key point need to be clarify is the webpage rendering process.
  </section>
  <section>
    We write HTML, CSS and Javascript code, browser processes them, and then, 
    image shown. <br>
    what happened underneath?

  <!-- <section data-markdown>
    Process 1: JavaScript/CSS
    > Typically JavaScript is used to handle work that will result 
    in visual changes, whether it’s jQuery’s animate function, sorting a data set, 
    or adding DOM elements to the page. It doesn’t have to be JavaScript that 
    triggers a visual change, though: CSS Animations, Transitions, and the Web 
    Animations API are also commonly used.

      Process 1: Style calculations
      > This is the process of figuring out which CSS rules apply to which elements 
      based on matching selectors. <br><br>
      > The DOM (Document Object Model) is formed from the HTML and Styles are loaded and parsed, forming the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).

    <div>
      Selector matching and figuring out which styles apply to which parts of the DOM.(this is super 
      fast unless you have a DOM tree with thousands upon thousands of elements and you 
      change a large part of said tree, either directly or through cascade)
    </div>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 2: Layout
    > Once the browser knows which rules apply to an element it can begin to 
    calculate how much **space it takes up** and **where** it is on screen. The web’s layout 
    model means that one element can **affect others**.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Process 3: Paint
    > Painting is the process of **filling in pixels**. It involves drawing out text, 
    colors, images, borders, and shadows, essentially every visual part of the 
    elements. The drawing is typically done onto **multiple surfaces**, often called 
    **layers**.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      In Chrome that combined tree of DOM and CSS is **rasterized** by some software 
      called `Skia`. <br><br>
      Essentially all the elements that need to be painted are distilled to a collection 
      of Skia calls that can be executed, and the output of is **a bunch of bitmaps**. 
      These bitmaps are uploaded to the GPU, and the GPU helps out by compositing them 
      together to give us the final picture on screen.<br>

      Paint is where you’re going to spend the vast majority of your time. <br>
      If you change a layout property you are almost certainly going to trigger paint.
    </textarea>

  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      Process 4: Compositing
      > Since the parts of the page were drawn into potentially multiple layers 
      they need to be drawn to the screen in the correct order so that the page 
      renders correctly. <br>
      > Compositing is where the painted parts of the page are put together for 
      displaying on screen.

  <section>Page rendered, now, you may modify, manipulate, navigate, scroll or do 
    something else within it, page will get changed.</section>
  <section>
    You may make page changes in these following ways.
  </section>
  <section>
    JS / CSS > Style > Layout > Paint > Composite

    <img data-src="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-full.jpg" />
    <div>
      If you change a “layout” property, so that’s one that changes an element’s 
      geometry(eg. width, top), the browser will have to check all the other elements and “reflow” the page. 
      Any affected areas will need to be repainted, and the final painted elements will need to be 
      composited back together.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    JS / CSS > Style > Paint > Composite

    <img data-src="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-no-layout.jpg" />
    <div>
      If you changed a “paint only” property (eg. backgdound-image, color), in other words one that does not 
      affect the layout of the page, then the browser skips layout, but it will still do paint.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    JS / CSS > Style > Composite
  
    <img data-src="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/rendering/images/intro/frame-no-layout-paint.jpg" />
    <div>
      If you change a property that requires neither layout nor paint, and the browser jumps to just do compositing.
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    Obviously, we would like to trigger less browser works to achieve better performace.

      Performance is the art of **avoiding work**, and making any work you do as efficient 
      as possible. <br><br>
      In many cases it's about working with the browser, **not against it**.

      - Stick to `transform` and `opacity` changes for your animations.
      - Promote moving elements with `will-change` or `translateZ`.
      - Avoid overusing promotion rules; layers require memory and management.

    Back to `window.requestAnimationFrame`.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      Have a look of defination again: <br> 
      The `window.requestAnimationFrame()` method tells 
      the browser that you wish to perform an animation and requests that the browser 
      call a specified function to update an animation before the **next repaint**. 
      The method takes a callback as an argument to be invoked before the repaint.
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-templae>
      A basic question:<br> 
      Does `window.requestAnimationFrame` always execute passed in function 
      roughly every 16ms?
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section>
    Actually, no.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Frames are only drawn when the browser is ready to paint. If browser spends a relative 
    long period time on passed in function, paint will execute utill this function finish.
  </section>
  <section>
    See the example-5-requestAnimationFrame/index-setInterval.html
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Another question about `window.requestAnimationFrame` is that, why we use it to handle 
    animation changes over more simple and compatible `setInterval` method.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      - Less CPU, GPU and memory usage <br>

      JavaScript timers continue to work even in background tabs, and even when the 
      corresponding browser window is minimized. Yet, `requestAnimationFrame` only draws 
      the animations that will be visible to the user. (no CPU power or battery life 
      is wasted drawing animations that are running in background tabs, minimized 
      windows, or otherwise hidden parts of a page.)

  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      - Browser Optimizations <br>

      Using `requestAnimationFrame` gives the browser the ability to optimize your 
      animations to make them smoother and more resource efficient. It eliminates 
      the possibility of unnecessary draws and can bunch together multiple 
      animations into a single reflow and repaint cycle.
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      - timer may queue <br>

      Saying for some reason the callback function takes more time to finish than 
      you have set up your timers for. Once the timers are up they will enqueue yet 
      another callback function, even though the previous one hasn’t finished running. 
      As this process repeats itself over time, you can quickly enqueue a virtually 
      infinite amount of timer code, causing the browser to stall.

    <textarea data-template>
      - timer may cause unnecessary paints <br/>

      Timer can only redraw animations at a fixed rate, so to make sure the animation 
      is smooth, we tend to err on the side of caution and choose a frequency slightly 
      higher than the display refresh rate. This, however, causes unnecessary drawing, 
      as some frames are drawn before the display refresh rate is ready to paint the 
      animation outcome and are therefore just discarded.
