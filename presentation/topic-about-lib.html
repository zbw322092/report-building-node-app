    When you would like to use a library in your project to help get your job done, 
    several points should be clear in your mind.

      Libary write in ES6 or above?  Is Babel ready? <br>
      Libary write in Typescript?  Are tscofig / Webpack ready? <br>
      It's a base framework using in my project? Webpack DLL may necessary. <br>
      You need wide browser support, except Babel, polyfill may include. <br>
      You don't care about old browser, you love new syntaxs and methods, library written in
      ES6 and above may your preference.

      - Is there dependencies? <br><br>
      vanilla javascript, jQuery as dependency, library for angular/react...
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      If dependencies exist, do them necessary? Eg. Is it deserve including jQuery if you just 
      want a simple functionality. <br>
      How can I integrate this lib/package into my existing framework (angular/react)?

    <textarea data-template>
      - Small enough? <br><br>
      Keep small as possible as you can. Less is more.
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      Do I need a comprehensive library which has a bunch of APIs and thousands loc? <br>
      Are these provided APIs all necessary? You may just frequently use a small part 
      of provided APIs, with the rests just used occasionally. <br>
      Can this library be split into small chunks. If no offical subsets provided, can I 
      do this myself?

      - Browser compatibility.<br><br>
      Does this library compatibility fits for my requirement?

  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      Something you need wide browser compatibility which should working on IE8. <br>
      But something you do not care about IEs, library codes which deal with IE compatibility 
      because redundant and you may drop it.
