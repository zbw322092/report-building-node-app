    `step()` method is clear now. It just roughly does following several thing:
    - caculate eclapsed time.
    - caculate current position according to start position
    - using `requestAnimationFrame` to perform position move recursively.
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    - Using easing function to CUSTOMIZE scroll process.
    - Using recursively execute function to move position to simulate smooth scrolling.

    Actually these two points are the common pratise of lots of scrolling related libraries.

    After we get core job done, one of the rest of the thing we need do is to figure out 
    **"where should it scroll to"**
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      `window.scrollTo`, `window.scrollBy`, `Element.prototype.scroll`, `Element.prototype.scrollBy` are easy. <br>
      Let's just have a look `Element.prototype.scrollIntoView` implementation.
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    Thinking about that: Page and element with scrollable overflow can scroll up and down, but the absloute position of an 
    element within scroll container(`window` or an overflowed element) is actually fixed.
  </section>
  <section>
    So, our job is figuring out the target element absloute geometry positon.
  </section>
  <section>
    Before doing absloute geometry positon caculation, we have to know how to get the parent scrollable container element.

  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      Comparing `Element.clientHeight` with `Element.scrollHeight` to get know whether contents overflowed. <br>
    </textarea>
  </section>
  <section>
    <img data-src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/346/Dimensions-client.png" />
    <div data-markdown>
      `clientHeight` can be calculated as CSS height + CSS padding - height of horizontal scrollbar (if present).
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <img data-src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/672/scrollHeight.png" />
    <div data-markdown>
      The `scrollHeight` value is equal to the minimum height the element would require in order to fit all the 
      content in the viewport **without using a vertical scrollbar**.
    </div>
  </section>
  <section data-markdown>
    `findScrollableParent` method judge whether target element's `parentNode` scrollable 
    to find out scrollable container.
  </section>
  <section>Now, back to position calculation</section>
  <section data-markdown>
    <textarea data-template>
      For an element within `window`: <br>
      `element.getBoundingClientRect().top` + `window.scrollY` <br><br>

      For an element within a scrollable parent element.: <br>
      `scrollableParent.scrollTop` + `clientRects.top` - `parentRects.top` <br><br>

      The same caculation for x axis position.
